### Back End :

## Project Schedule :
* We here used the agile methodology in the development of Visitor Management System.
* The Agile software development methodology is one of the simplest and effective processes to turn a vision for a business need into software solutions. Agile is a term used to describe software development approaches that employ continual planning, learning, improvement, team collaboration, evolutionary development, and early delivery. It encourages flexible responses to change.
* The agile software development emphasizes on four core values.

1. Individual and team interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

* It took two sprints of two weeks( including backend development, front end development, integration, and testing) each in this project
